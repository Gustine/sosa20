This module adds a sidebar displaying the Sosa-Stradonitz numbering of the root individual’s ancestors. As the calculation on the fly can be excessively long if the number of generations is large, it is preferable to calculate the numbers and store them in a wt_sosa table created by this module. For each person and each GEDCOM, it contains the Sosa number and the corresponding generation.
