This module adds a sidebar displaying the Sosa-Stradonitz numbering of the root individualâ€™s ancestors. As the calculation on the fly can be excessively long if the number of generations is large, it is preferable to calculate the numbers and store them in a wt_sosa table created by this module. For each person and each GEDCOM, it contains the Sosa number and the corresponding generation.
